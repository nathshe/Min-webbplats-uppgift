   <h3>About the wonder of Espresso</h3>
   
   <p>
Espresso(Itailian), (means "expressed" from esprimere, "to express" or "to force out") is coffee brewed by expressing or forcing out a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency). As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. Espresso is also the base for other drinks such as a caff√® latte, cappuccino, caffe macchiato, caffe mocha, flat white, or caffe Americano. Here are some examples of drinks you can make from espresso shots:</p>
